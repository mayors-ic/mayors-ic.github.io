# Cultivating creative public spaces

The City of Kingston challenges students to think outside the box 
and develop dynamic public spaces in under-utilized venues. 
Equipped with information and creativity, 
inspired students should submit a proposal 
to re-imagine one of the Kingston locations listed below and make it home to an exciting, 
engaging and people-friendly experience.

Choose one of the following locations to re-imagine:

* Amphitheatre in Springer Market Square

* Ontario Street â€“ closed from Brock to Clarence. 

* Portsmouth Olympic Harbour
