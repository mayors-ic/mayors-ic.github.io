# Enhancing local attraction for youth

<div class="row">
<span class="image left"><img src="images/nightlife.jpg" alt="" /></span>
The City of Kingston actively promotes the attraction and engagement of citizens 
and visitors by promoting Kingston's rich history, culture, talent, and scenery. 
We have an opportunity to better integrate our community's 
large post-secondary student demographic 
by developing events, programming, and initiatives that appeal to their interests. 
How can we make Kingston a better place to live and play for a younger demographic?
