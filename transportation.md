# Enhancing active transportation networks

<div class="row">
<span class="image left"><img src="images/transit.jpg" alt="" /></span>
According to the Kingston Transportation Master Plan, 
the existing active transportation mode share is 14 per cent 
(13 per cent walking and 1 per cent cycling). 
However, almost 40 per cent of residents live within 5 km of their work places. 
The City of Kingston has an ambitious goal of achieving 20 per cent active-transportation
mode-share for peak travel times by 2034. 
We want student input on one of two active transportation-related challenges.

**Choose one of the following:**

* Design a â€˜skeleton' network of bicycle routes/lanes to be maintained year-round and 
  cleared of snow to allow for an all-season cycling network in the City. 
  In other words, identify an appropriate winter cycling network, 
  connecting key areas, 
  while understanding that the network needs to remain small enough 
  that it can be cleared and maintained by busy City crews.
* Propose recommendations to prioritize pedestrian use of the Brock and King Street intersection.
  Equipped with 60 hours of video data, collision history, traffic counts and vehicle speed data,
  students will have the information needed 
  to recommend a traffic-calming plan for the intersection.

## Resources

* Average annual traffic data for pedestrians, cyclists and automobiles 
  can be requested for any intersection in the city 
  (if we have completed a count at the intersection in question).
