<h2>What is the Mayor's Innovation Challenge?</h2>
<p>
    Kingston faces a series of complex challenges as we work toward our vision of becoming a smart, livable, 21st century city
    and is seeking solutions from student innovators. The Mayor's Innovation Challenge is a competition calling on teams
    of students from Kingston's major post-secondary institutions to develop innovative proposals to address a challenge
    faced by the City of Kingston. In partnership with Queen's University, St. Lawrence College and the Royal Military College
    of Canada, the City is hosting a collaborative problem-solving platform, made possible by the generous support of Bell
    Canada, the Queen's Centre for Advanced Computing, and the Queen's Centre for Social Impact.
</p>

<p>
    Current and recently graduated post-secondary students are eligible to submit proposals addressing challenges in one of the
    three categories:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="/public-spaces">Cultivating creative public spaces</a></li>
    <li><a href="/transportation">Strengthening active transportation networks</a></li>
    <li><a href="/enhancing-attractions">Enhancing local attractions</a></li>
</ol>

<p>
    The creators of the top submissions, selected by the Mayor and senior staff, will be invited to present their proposals at
    the Mayor's Innovation Challenge Pitch-Off event on Friday, Mar. 2. Winning team members will each be given a four-month
    paid internship to implement their project to impact the lives of 125,000 people in our city. The project itself will
    have a $10,000 budget and members of the winning team will work alongside City mentors to complete it â€“ and gain meaningful
    career experience.
