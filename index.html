<h2>What is Mayor's Innovation Challenge?</h2>
<p>
Kingston faces a series of complex challenges as we work toward our vision of becoming a smart, livable, 
21st century city and is seeking solutions from student innovators. 
The Mayor's Innovation Challenge is a competition calling on teams of students from
Kingston's major post-secondary institutions to develop innovative proposals to address a challenge faced by the City of Kingston. 
In partnership with Queen's University, St. Lawrence College and the Royal Military College of Canada, 
the City will host a collaborative problem-solving platform, made possible by the generous support of Bell Canada, 
the Queen's Centre for Advanced Computing, and the Queen's Centre for Social Impact.
