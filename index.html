    <h1>HPC Carpentry:</br>Teaching basic skills for high-performance computing.</h1>
    <p>
    HPC Carpentry is a set of teaching materials designed to help new users take advantage of high-performance computing systems. 
    No prior computational experience is required - 
    these lessons are ideal for either an in-person workshop or independent study.

<h2>What is HPC Carpentry?</h2>
<p>
Each of these lessons are designed to teach how to interact with a compute cluster in a specific way.
The first lesson, <a href="https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-intro/">Intro to HPC</a>, 
is a general introduction to the bash command line and submitting jobs on a typical HPC cluster. 
The second two lessons focus on two separate use cases for HPC: 
running large numbers of compute jobs (often with complex inter-job dependencies),
or creating parallel programs that execute across one or more compute nodes.
Each lesson takes roughly a full day to teach (or work through independently), 
and it is intended that the Intro to HPC lesson be taught together with either the 
Python or Chapel component to form a two-day workshop. 
</p>

<p>
Workshops are intended to be fully interactive and taught in the 
<a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">"Software Carpentry"</a> format:
instruction is done live, with learners coding along with workshop instructors.
Frequent excercises and test problems have been added to ensure students have a chance to try things on their own. 
No prior computing experience is required or expected.
