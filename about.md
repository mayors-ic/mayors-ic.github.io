The winning team members gain an invaluable opportunity to launch their careers by tackling an issue important to them, 
while working alongside municipal leaders. 
Each winning team member will also receive a paid internship and 
the team's project receives a $10,000 implementation budget.

## How do I participate?

at least 50 per cent of whom are now enrolled in one of Kingston's post-secondary institutions. 
Teams will submit a single proposal outlining their innovative idea in one of three challenge categories.

At least one member from each team must attend a workshop in order to qualify to submit an application. 
Extenuating circumstances will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
